<h1> Wordle (CLI version) </h1>
Original Wordle: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle
<p> Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022.</p>
In this project, I have created a very similar version of the game which executes right on your terminal as a Python program.
